# Urban Vegetation Modeling Tool

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a tool for incorporating vegetation into 3D urban models. Leveraging data from sources such as OpenStreetMap and Mapbox, our goal is to create a realistic representation of trees within the model. Trees significantly impact air and ground temperatures, as well as building energy consumption through shade and wind protection.

## Features

- Integration of vegetation data into 3D urban models
- Realistic representation of trees, including shape, size, location, and density
- Consideration of vegetation's impact on air and ground temperatures, as well as building energy consumption
- Efficient and scalable method suitable for large urban areas
