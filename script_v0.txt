- Frame 1 (COVER)


- Frame 2-3 (THERMAL IMAGES) : Urban areas are intricate systems influenced by various factors,
including vegetation, particularly trees, which play a vital role in
shaping microclimates, energy consumption, and overall livability.


- Frame 4 (NYC MESH) : This project focuses on integrating vegetation, specifically trees,
into 3D geometric models of urban environments to enhance the accuracy and
realism of thermal and energy simulations.


- Frame 5-6-7-8 (OBJECTIVES) : Leveraging data from sources like OpenStreetMap,
the project aims to identify tree positions and attributes within urban landscapes
and generate a library of 3D tree models for integration into terrain meshes.


- Frame 9-10-11 (ROADMAP) : the project follows a roadmap with defined milestones
to deliver versions : - V0 due by March 26, 2024 (today)
                      - V1 due by April 23, 2024
                      - v2 due by May 28, 2024
